    - [x] Thomas

## Week 2: Getting Pytorch Down
### 2020-01-14
- [x] Step 1 & 2.
    - [x] 1: Implement a feedforward neural network and train it on the MNIST dataset.
    - [x] 2: Implement a convolutional neural network and train it on the MNIST dataset.
    - [x] When done, send Andrei mail for pruning code.
    - [ ] Optional: do the same for the CIFAR10 dataset.

### 2020-01-16
- [x] Step 3.
    - [x] Incorporate pruning mechanism.
    - [x] Implement resetting function.


## Week 3: Perform Experiments
### 2020-01-21
- [ ] Finalize code.
    - [ ] Stefan: Check bias is unaffected by alternative inits.
    - [ ] Thomas: Finalize logging. Everything neat.
- [ ] Ellis: write for paper: methods
- [ ] All: divide the experiment runs. Structure this in `experiments.md`

### 2020-01-22 -> 2020-01-24
- [ ] All: Start running experiments as divided on 2020-01-21.
- [ ] All: During meetings, keep each other updated and discuss progress.

### 2020-01-24 (end of day meeting)
- [ ] All: Discuss planning for interpretation of results.
- [ ] All: Discuss planning for writing paper.
- [ ] All: Discuss planning for preparing presentation.
- [ ] ALl: Fill in planning for this week in detailed manner.


__End of latest update.__

## Week 4: Do Optional Things and Write Report
### 2020-01-27
- [ ] Step 6 & 7.
    - [ ] Based on the above results, is it possible, then, to construct a
          custom initialization schema that improves the robustness further?
        - [ ] Compare the different initialisations. Is there a major difference, and if so, what component
                is responsible? Is it usable for a custom initialisation schema?
        - [ ] If it is possible to construct a custom schema, let's experiment with it. Does it improve robustness?
    - [ ] Check whether the schema built on (6) generalizes to other pruning methods.

### 2020-01-28
- [ ] Presentations
    - [ ] Powerpoint (?)
    - [ ] Text

### 2020-01-31
- [ ] Final Report
